##
## Boolean Value
## Must have either True or False and they must be capitalized
##
##boolvar = True
##isAwake = True
##isInClass = True

## when you print it out it is not a string it will be a boolean
##
##print(type(boolvar))
##print(isAwake)
##print(isInClass)
##
## Logical Expressions, Either greater than or less than.
##
##logicExp = 12==5
##print(logicExp)
## when you print out that logicExp it will come out either as true or false
## you can add an equals sign to the end of the less than or greater than to check to see if it is equal/
## if you want to see if it will not be equal to it you have to do a !=
## when you want to see if the number is equal to something then you have to do == two equal signs
## you need to know all of the operators.
##> greter than
##< less than
##>= less than or equal to
##>= greater that or equal to
##!= does not equal to 
##== equals to

##input1 = input("Enter a Number: ")
